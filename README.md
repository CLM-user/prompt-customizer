# Mod
modding for the script for adding new things!

# Modding instructions
Basically you can make your own mod to add new features
to make a proper mod please make a file where it will contain an `.pmod` txt file
you can add variables to it that can add things, please refer to the `colors.pmod` mod in the branch

# Mod rules
Please follow those rules so your mod can be accepted
1. Dont add real code on the `.pmod` file
2. please add a .txt containing a install guide and description of the mod, for now my script cant install the mods directly.

# Notes
if you attempt to try adding a mod that doesnt follow the rules i will tell you about it and you can still upload another
renember to start a pull request to submit your mod
if you break rule 1 more than 3 times we wont let you submit any mod for 1 week
